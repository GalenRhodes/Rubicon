/// <code>[Optional](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/optional/)</code> conditional. To test an
/// optional for `nil` you can use an `if` statement like this:
/// ```
///     if let v = possiblyNil {
///         /* do something with v */
///     }
///     else {
///         /* do something when possiblyNil is 'nil' */
///     }
/// ```
///
/// This is fine but I wanted to do the same thing with a conditional expression like you can in C/C++/Objective-C:
/// ```
///     let x = (let v = possiblyNil ? v.name : "no name") // This will not compile. üò©
/// ```
///
/// I know I could always do this:
/// ```
///     let x = ((possiblyNil == nil) ? "no name" : v!.name) // This will compile.
/// ```
/// But the OCD side of me really dislikes that '!' being there even though I know it will never cause a fatal
/// error. It just rubs up against that nerve seeing it there. ü§¢
///
/// So I created this function to simulate the functionality of the above using closures.
///
/// ```
///     let x = when(possiblyNil, isNil: "No Name") { $0.name } // This will compile. üòÅ
/// ```

/// - Parameters:
///   - expression: The expression to test for `nil`.
///   - c1: The closure to execute if `obj` IS `nil`.
///   - c2: The closure to execute if `obj` is NOT `nil`. The unwrapped value of `obj` is passed to the closure.
/// - Returns: The value returned from whichever closure is executed.
/// - Throws: Any exception thrown by whichever closure is executed.
