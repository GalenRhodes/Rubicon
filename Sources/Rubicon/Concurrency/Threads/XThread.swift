/// This class offers a little bit more flexibility over the standard Foundation [Thread](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/thread) class. The standard
/// Thread class found in [Apple's Foundation library](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation) is pretty bare bones. For starters, unlike the
/// [Process](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/process) class, it lacks any way to [join](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=programming-joining-threads)
/// another thread - that is to say, put one thread to sleep until another thread finishes executing.
///
/// The other things the standard Foundation Thread class lacks is an easy way to tell if the thread threw an error during execution or to have the thread return a value from
/// it's execution.
///
/// This implementation attempts to solve all of that by behaving similar to [Java's Concurrency](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/package-summary.html)
/// library's [Callable](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Callable.html)/[Future](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Future.html)
